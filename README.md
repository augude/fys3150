### Code and material for Project 1 in FYS3150. 
The code is structured in folders for each problem.

To build and run all the code, navigate into the folder 'Project1' and use the command:

'make all'

in the terminal. 
This will call makefiles in each folders which in turn build and run the code for the respective problems. If you only want to run the code for a spesific problem, navigate to that folder and use the same command.
